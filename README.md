# Grifin Full Stack Engineer Test Drive
## Purpose
This test drive exercise aims to simulate what it is like to work with the Grifin team in a low-pressure way that closely resembles how we work together in real life. You will get a sense of how our engineers work, and, in turn, we get to understand what it is like to work with you.
## How it Works
1. Your interviewer will provide access to this code repo by sending an invitation to the email address associated with your GitHub handle.
2. Once you've gained access to the codebase, please send a confirmation message to the interviewer.
3. Review the [SHAPEUP.md](docs/SHAPEUP.md) file, which contains the detailed specification for the features to implement.
4. **Optional** - Before beginning the coding portion of the test drive, you may schedule a 15-minute Q&A session with the interviewer to clarify any outstanding questions or confirm your understanding of the scope.
5. Once you've completed implementation, create a PR and assign the following users as reviewers: `gregmundy`,  `DillonCC97`, and `Marjan-Ivanovski`.
6. Please send an email to your point of contact letting them know you submitted the test drive code.
7. Your point of contact will schedule a code review session with you and the team to discuss the PR.
