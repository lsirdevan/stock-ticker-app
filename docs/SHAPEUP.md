# Project Shape Up
## Problem
Many of our customers are first-time investors who have yet to learn about the companies that build out their portfolios. For example, investors may be unfamiliar with a company named Darden. However, they regularly purchase meals at restaurants like Olive Garden, Capital Grille, and Longhorn, all brands of the Darden Group.  

## Solution
To help customers learn more about the various companies, we've decided to invest in developing a companion app that enables consumers to search for publicly traded companies and retrieve details about these companies. Once a user finds a company of interest, they should be able to add it to their "favorites" list, where they can access it at any point.
